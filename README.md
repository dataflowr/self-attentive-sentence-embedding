# Self-attentive Sentence Embedding

We submitted tree model.

-The first one called yelp_all_model.ipynb is just a colab to train the model on all the yelp dataset

-The second one bert.ipynb is a bert one containing also a heatmap implementation.

-And a third one longtransformer.py using Longformers to use all the words in the text(not only the 512 first ones)

We add :

-a heatmap.py file where a base implementation approach of a heatmap is proposed 
-sample.tex is a heatmap tex file for a sentence we try on the bert model

TO visualize the heatmap, you need to copy the sample.tex in Overleaf application and compile it
